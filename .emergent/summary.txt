<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the YooCreat MVP from scratch, addressing initial requirements for AI-powered ebook generation with a React frontend and FastAPI backend, using MongoDB. The development was highly iterative, frequently encountering and resolving critical issues related to authentication (JWT and Google OAuth), CORS policies, environment variable handling, frontend rendering, and backend API contract mismatches. A significant portion of the work involved debugging frontend-backend communication, specifically around cookie-based authentication and URL resolution in production. Export functionality for multiple formats was also implemented, requiring further debugging for proper header handling and event propagation. The project is currently at a stage where core features are functional, but the AI-generated content needs refinement based on user feedback and a provided PDF example. The engineer frequently leveraged internal troubleshooting tools to diagnose and resolve complex issues.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary:** Main FastAPI application. Defines all API endpoints, database interactions, user authentication (registration, login, Google OAuth), ebook creation, AI-powered TOC and content generation, and cover generation.
    -   **Changes:** Initially set up core structure, then modified for Google OAuth, session handling, CORS configuration, Pydantic model type flexibility (), and enhanced AI prompts for generation and cover. Also, the  endpoint was changed to accept  in the request body instead of a query parameter.
-   **/app/backend/exporter.py**:
    -   **Summary:** A new module responsible for handling various ebook export formats (PDF, EPUB, HTML, MOBI, DOCX). Contains logic to convert the ebook content into these formats.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created file to encapsulate export logic using libraries like , , , <p></p>.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary:** The main React component for the frontend. Manages application state, routes (using ), user authentication context, the ebook creation form, ebook viewing, AI generation triggers, and export/cover generation buttons.
    -   **Changes:** Extensive modifications including: fixing import errors, updating React Hooks dependencies, implementing the AuthProvider and AuthPage for JWT and Google OAuth flow (handling session IDs and redirects), dynamically setting , adding UI for export buttons, cover generation, and implementing  for export dropdown buttons, and including Authorization headers for API calls.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary:** Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to include , , , , , , , <p></p>.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Summary:** Frontend environment variables, specifically .
    -   **Changes:** Modified to handle dynamic  based on environment (localhost or relative path for production).
-   **/etc/supervisor/conf.d/backend.conf & /etc/supervisor/conf.d/frontend.conf**:
    -   **Summary:** Supervisor configuration files to run the FastAPI backend and React frontend as background services.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created to ensure services run continuously and are managed by Supervisor.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Google Authentication Redirection:** The Google OAuth authentication still redirects to the login page after a brief flash of the home page, instead of the dashboard.
-   **AI Ebook Content Formatting:**
    -   Remove redundant chapter title repetition.
    -   Eliminate # Introduction or similar Markdown tags appearing in chapter content.
    -   Ensure consistent and uniform heading styles (H2/H3) for sub-sections.
    -   Add a brief, uniform conclusion/synthesis (Conclusion or Key Points) at the end of every chapter.
    -   Integrate a Call-to-Action (CTA) or reflection prompt at the end of each chapter.
    -   Generate a more detailed Table of Contents, including main sub-titles (H2/H3) with page numbers.
    -   Include legal mentions, copyright, and ISBN pages.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving issues related to the AI-generated ebook content. The user provided detailed feedback based on a generated PDF, highlighting several formatting inconsistencies and missing elements in the AI-generated content. Specifically, the user pointed out redundant chapter titles, incorrect use of Markdown for sub-headings, inconsistent sub-section styling, missing chapter conclusions, lack of per-chapter CTAs, and a sparse table of contents, along with the absence of legal pages. The AI engineer has just analyzed the user-provided PDF () to understand these defects thoroughly. The next logical step is to modify the AI generation prompts within the backend's  file to address these specific content and formatting requirements.
